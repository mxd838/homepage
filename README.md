## Issues to fix
- quote container getting too much  space relative to the quote itself
- test and eventually fix responsiveness (search websites testing that automatically)
- cors security issue (doesn't allow to activate javascript by opening the local path on my computer)
- fetch api for background images, ideally according to weather forecast and time of day
